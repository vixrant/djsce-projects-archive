  The obstacles which I encountered in this project

It is a fantastic project! The features are well thought and not over-engineered. Problem is, the judges of the hackathon expected "trendy" technologies like AI/ ML or blockchain.

The whole Hackathon was really shady. On their website, they said there was a cash prize of ‚Çπ60k, ‚Çπ30k, and ‚Çπ15 by Xinfin. But one day before the hackathon, they change it to "Prizes 2019". Like wtf? The entire hackathon we asked what the cash prizes were and they refused to tell us. Their website said "Prizes worth ‚Çπ1L", but then after the hackathon, the participants from top 10 teams told us that the cash prizes were ‚Çπ20k, ‚Çπ12k, and ‚Çπ8k. Xinfin was not even a sponsor. Also, no team from my problem statement was selected, and the judge was laughing through some of my friends' projects. Really felt bad after working 24hrs on the project, especially considering the people who gave the PS liked the solution.

Really, the whole thing was so scammy. I wouldn't have even went for this hackathon knowing the low cash prizes.
