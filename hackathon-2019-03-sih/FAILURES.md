  The obstacles which I encountered in this project
  <hr>
</div>

1. We had too many different projects. App, Web, Pi, Nodemcu, Server. It was too confusing.

2. I rewrote my Raspberry Pi server 5 times. First using Python - aiortc, then using Chrome JS - WebRTC, then using Node JS - Peerjs, then using Node JS - node-webrtc, then finally we settled back on Chrome JS - WebRTC. Which was conceptually very bad.

3. We didn't help in each other's projects at all. Lack of communication.

4. Our web project was completed but the android app was really buggy. The judge in the 3rd (final) judging round asked us for the android application. It didn't work and he left the table just by seeing that it didn't work. It was really disheartening.

5. Our sensors didn't work. We should've done the sensors part before the hackathon.

6. One team member didn't contribute to development at all.

Too many mistakes. In India's largest hackathon.
Our product was ready. But there were minor faults everywhere.
