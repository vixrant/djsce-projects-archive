# Nodemcu

In our solution, we do not assume that the patient will have any WiFi enabled sensor. Using Nodemcu, we take in
the sensor values using analog input and then send the values to Raspberry Pi using HTTP requests on the local
network.

We used a heartrate sensor to implement this but the sensor was faulty.
