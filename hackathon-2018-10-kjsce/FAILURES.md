  The obstacles which I encountered in this project

</div>

1. Hey, I have a React development server running at port 3000 and a backend API running at port 8000. Why am I not able to fetch data?
CORS! I have to enable CORS on the backend server. Look at this: [Express CORS middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html)

2. My authentication backend was working. But my login template wasn't. This was my first big project in React and I skipped [Working with React Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).
Hey, the new React 16.7 Hooks are very useful for this by the way.

3. I was working alone on this project, so work distribution was a problem.

Other than that, the project turned out pretty good. I did not face any headaches this time. Remote database and local databases worked fine. API worked fine. React worked fine. Everything worked out in the end.
