_General public can report a minor fire by tweeting to a Twitter chatbot._

![volunteer](/docs/img/pwa.jpg) <br>
_These reports are then verified by a trained volunteer. Firestations in Mumbai train over 2000 volunteers all over Mumbai. This is a Progressive Web App._

![map](/docs/img/map.png) <br>
_The reports are then displayed on the admin site._
_The admin map tells you where the fire is and which is the nearest firesation to deploy a firefighters unit to._

## Build instructions

#### React Dashboard:

Install all packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

- To run the server, `npm start` or `yarn start`.

- To build the webpack, `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

#### Firebase:

This project relies on firebase and firebase-tools for working.

I have used: *Authentication (Email & Password provider)* and *Cloud Firestore*.

- Deploy the functions to firebase by running `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy` in the `functions/` directory.
- You can serve the functions using `npm run serve` or `yarn serve`.

#### Chatbot:

This solution depends on my configured Dialogflow. `mumareas.csv` is a CSV files of all the areas in Mumbai, taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighbourhoods_in_Mumbai).

## Solution technology Stack

1. Firebase for backend.
2. React for web app and PWA.
3. Dialogflow for Twitter chatbot.
