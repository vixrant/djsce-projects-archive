Let me tell you what happened.

This hackathon took place in my college. Everyone had high hopes for me.<br>
I went alone this time because I wasn't in the mood to work in a team after my recent lose at SIH 2019.<br>
Things were working out great. Firebase reduced the work load on me and the frontend was looking beautiful.<br>

In the judging round, I had a complete product - A PWA for volunteers, a Twitter chatbot, a beautiful working Google Maps (By the way, many people failed to use Google Maps in their projects).<br>
My pitching was so fantastic. People in the room gathered around me to see what I was saying and what I had built.
I answered the judges with a zeal. I had answers for everything that they had.<br>

Before going to the next team, the judges gave suggestions on how to improve the project. The ended the suggestion with "do this in your next hackathon". That sounded wrong. Also, the judges didn't use my project at all. They didn't even touch it.

So when the first round of judging ended, the judges were selecting the top 10 teams for the final round of juding. My friend in the organising committee called me up. And he said something that hit me hard.

"Do not take team Jalebi Fafada at all because that guy doesn't know teamwork."
