> *NOTE:* If you're running this program either on the website shakal-io.netlify.com or on your `localhost`, do note that without a TURN relay server, this program will only work on your local network! Due to how symmetric NATs work, it is impossible as of now to set up a true peer-to-peer connection over the internet.
